# Lance Ashdown — Portfolio site

This is a lightweight static portfolio (plain HTML/CSS) meant for **free hosting on GitHub Pages**.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — home
- `work.html` — public writing sample links (generated from your resume links)
- `case-studies.html` — short case studies (problem → approach → impact)
- `code.html` — code samples page + a publish-ready template utility
- `resume.html` — resume download page
- `contact.html` — contact details
- `data/links.json` — extracted links from `resume.docx`
- `resume.docx` — your current resume (copied in)

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo named: **lanceashdown.github.io**
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo root (same level as `index.html`).
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
4. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
5. Branch: **main**, Folder: **/(root)**
6. Your site will be at: `https://lanceashdown.github.io`

## Customize quickly
- Update the summary text in `index.html`
- Replace placeholders in `code.html` with your public repo/gist links
- Optionally add `resume.pdf`

## Notes
This template avoids confidential/internal materials. Publish only code and writing samples you’re allowed to share.
